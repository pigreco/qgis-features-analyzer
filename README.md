# QGIS Features Analyzer

Python tools to extract and analyze QGIS features from changelog archives. Converts release notes into structured CSV data with developer attribution, funding sources, and version metadata.

## 📋 Description

This project provides Python scripts to automate the extraction and analysis of QGIS features from official changelog pages (versions 3.0 to 3.44):

1. **download_qgis_zips.py** - Downloads ZIP archives containing changelogs in Markdown format
2. **extract_raw_features.py** - Extracts raw information from Markdown files without normalization
3. **normalize_features.py** - Normalizes developer names and data from the raw CSV file
4. **extract_developers_companies.py** - Extracts a mapping of developers to their associated companies

## 🚀 Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/pigreco/qgis-features-analyzer.git
cd qgis-features-analyzer

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📦 Dependencies

- `requests` >= 2.31.0
- `beautifulsoup4` >= 4.12.0

## 💻 Usage

### 1. Download changelogs

```bash
python3 scripts/download_qgis_zips.py
```

This script:
- Reads the list of changelog URLs from `changelog_urls.txt`
- Downloads ZIP archives from official QGIS changelogs (versions 3.0-3.44)
- Saves files to the `data/qgis_downloads/` directory
- Shows progress status for each version

### 2. Extract and normalize features

```bash
# Step 1: Extract raw data
python3 scripts/extract_raw_features.py

# Step 2: Normalize data
python3 scripts/normalize_features.py

# Step 3 (optional): Extract developers and companies mapping
python3 scripts/extract_developers_companies.py
```

**Scripts description:**
- `extract_raw_features.py` extracts raw information without normalization and generates `output/qgis_features_raw.csv`
- `normalize_features.py` reads the raw CSV and applies normalization rules to generate `output/qgis_features_normalized.csv`
- `extract_developers_companies.py` analyzes the data to create a mapping of developers to their companies and saves it to `output/developers_companies.txt`

## 📊 Output

The generated CSV files contain the following columns:

- **Version** - QGIS version (e.g., 3.44, 3.42, etc.)
- **Category** - Feature category
- **Feature** - Feature name/description
- **Developer** - Developer who implemented the feature
- **Funder** - Organization/entity that funded the development

### Output files:
- **output/qgis_features_raw.csv** - Generated by `extract_raw_features.py` (raw data without normalization)
- **output/qgis_features_normalized.csv** - Generated by `normalize_features.py` (normalized data)
- **output/developers_companies.txt** - Generated by `extract_developers_companies.py` (mapping of developers to companies)

## 🔧 Configuration

### Supported versions

The script supports the following QGIS versions:
- 3.44, 3.42, 3.40, 3.38, 3.36, 3.34, 3.32, 3.30
- 3.28, 3.26, 3.24, 3.22, 3.20, 3.18, 3.16, 3.14
- 3.12, 3.10, 3.8, 3.6.0, 3.4-LTR, 3.2.0, 3.0.0

To add new versions, edit the [changelog_urls.txt](changelog_urls.txt) file by adding new URLs (one per line). Lines starting with `#` are treated as comments.

## 📝 Notes

- The `data/qgis_downloads/` directory is ignored by git to avoid versioning large files
- The `output/` directory contains all generated CSV and text files
- The script automatically handles any download or parsing errors
- Files are processed in order from the most recent to the oldest version
