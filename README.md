# QGIS Features Analyzer

Python tools to extract and analyze QGIS features from changelog archives. Converts release notes into structured CSV data with developer attribution, funding sources, and version metadata. The project includes both a combined approach and a modular approach for extraction and normalization.

## 📋 Description

This project provides Python scripts to automate the extraction and analysis of QGIS features from official changelog pages (versions 3.0 to 3.44):

1. **download_qgis_zips.py** - Downloads ZIP archives containing changelogs in Markdown format
2. **extract_features_from_zips.py** - Extracts and normalizes structured information from Markdown files and generates a CSV (combined approach)
3. **extract_raw_features.py** - Extracts raw information from Markdown files without normalization
4. **normalize_features.py** - Normalizes developer names and data from the raw CSV file

## 🚀 Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/pigreco/qgis-features-analyzer.git
cd qgis-features-analyzer

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📦 Dependencies

- `requests` >= 2.31.0
- `beautifulsoup4` >= 4.12.0

## 💻 Usage

### 1. Download changelogs

```bash
python3 download_qgis_zips.py
```

This script:
- Downloads ZIP archives from official QGIS changelogs (versions 3.0-3.44)
- Saves files to the `qgis_downloads/` directory
- Shows progress status for each version

### 2. Extract features

**Option A: Combined approach (extraction + normalization)**

```bash
python3 extract_features_from_zips.py
```

This script:
- Reads all ZIP archives in the `qgis_downloads/` directory
- Extracts and normalizes information from each Markdown file
- Generates a CSV file `qgis_features_extracted.csv` with structured and normalized data

**Option B: Modular approach (extraction and normalization separated)**

```bash
# Step 1: Extract raw data
python3 extract_raw_features.py

# Step 2: Normalize data
python3 normalize_features.py
```

These scripts:
- `extract_raw_features.py` extracts raw information without normalization and generates `qgis_features_raw.csv`
- `normalize_features.py` reads the raw CSV and applies normalization rules to generate `qgis_features_normalized.csv`

## 📊 Output

The generated CSV files contain the following columns:

- **Version** - QGIS version (e.g., 3.44, 3.42, etc.)
- **Release Date** - Version release date
- **Category** - Feature category
- **Feature** - Feature name/description
- **Developer** - Developer who implemented the feature
- **Funder** - Organization/entity that funded the development

### Output files:
- **qgis_features_extracted.csv** - Generated by `extract_features_from_zips.py` (combined approach)
- **qgis_features_raw.csv** - Generated by `extract_raw_features.py` (raw data without normalization)
- **qgis_features_normalized.csv** - Generated by `normalize_features.py` (normalized data)

## 🔧 Configuration

### Supported versions

The script supports the following QGIS versions:
- 3.44, 3.42, 3.40, 3.38, 3.36, 3.34, 3.32, 3.30
- 3.28, 3.26, 3.24, 3.22, 3.20, 3.18, 3.16, 3.14

To add new versions, modify the `CHANGELOG_URLS` list in [download_qgis_zips.py](download_qgis_zips.py).

## 📝 Notes

- The `qgis_downloads/` directory is ignored by git to avoid versioning large files
- The script automatically handles any download or parsing errors
- Files are processed in order from the most recent to the oldest version
